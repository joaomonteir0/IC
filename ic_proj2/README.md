# IC - Project 2

## Part I - BitStream Class

The `BitStream` class is responsible for efficient bit manipulations, allowing reading and writing of individual bits and sequences of bits in binary files. This class is used for low-level operations necessary for data encoding and decoding.

### Compile and Run

In the directory, execute the following commands to get results:

```bash
cd part1/
make run
```

If you want to delete the outputs of the execution, you can write the following commands:

```bash
make clean
```

### Output

- **output.bin**: Binary file containing the encoded integers.
- **decoded.txt**: Text file containing the decoded integers.

## Part II - Golomb Coding

In this part, we developed a C++ class for Golomb coding, a type of universal code often used in data compression. Golomb coding is particularly effective for encoding integers with a geometric distribution and can handle both positive and negative values.

### Compile and Run

In the directory, execute the following commands:

```bash
cd part2/
make run
```

If you want to delete the outputs of the execution, you can write the following commands:

```bash
make clean
```

### Output

- **output.bin**: Binary file containing the encoded integers.
- **decoded.txt**: Text file containing the decoded integers.
